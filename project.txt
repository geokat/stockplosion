[COMPANY] proposes to develop an application that will use
STOCKPLOSION's Market API to provide a summary of recent stock
performance and an automated trading recommendation. The application
will provide a single-page web interface allowing the analyst to enter
the ticker symbol/name for a company's stock and get a simple
buy/sell/wait recommendation in return.

The summary will include an interactive chart of the latest stock
performance based on a 31-day window (as returned by the Market API)
that allows the analyst to browse back to earlier periods for
comparison. The recommendation will be based on where the current
stock price is in relation to the period's maximum and minimum
prices. The strategy is to maximize short-term gains by selling
immediately after reaching the maximum and buying after reaching the
minimum price for the period.

The UI will also include a dropdown box with symbols/names of all
companies currently listed on the Stockplosion Exchange, allowing the
analyst to select/enter the company in which they are
interested. Using a one-page application layout makes the process
repeatable and efficient, as no page reloads are required.

The following is the breakdown of billable time for each
stage/component of the project.
